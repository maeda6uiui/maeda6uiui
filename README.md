# Overview

Thank you for finding me in the profound crevasse of the Internet!
I don't specialize in anything, I just take a hand in what seems interesting to me.
But if you allow me to declare something, I'll think of myself as a full-stack engineer.

I rarely post on X, I only leave a like to interesting posts, and DMs are not open.
But if you mention me, I would respond to it when I'm willing.
